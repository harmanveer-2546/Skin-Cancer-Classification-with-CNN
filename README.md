# Skin Cancer Classification

Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy(American Cancer Society) which is primarily diagnosed
visually, starting with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic(related to skin)
analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the
DNA of skin cells. The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells. The aim
of this was to try to classify images of skin lesions with the help of convolutional neural networks. The
deep neural networks show humongous potential for image classification while taking into account the large
variability exhibited by the environment. Here we trained images based on the pixel values and classified them
on the basis of disease labels.
